## Education
Samara National Research University named after academician S.P. Korolev 2015-2019.

## About me
I finished the bachelor of science 3 months ago, and continue education in the same place.
At the same time I'm learning JS and another methods web development to find job in this way.
While it's interesting to me, I will continue to move in this direction.

## Skills and experience
I have basic skills in **Java**(include **JavaFX**, work with image),
**C++**(less then Java, only basic), **Oracle database**(only university labs).
And much better in **JS**(only basic JS), **CSS**, **HTML**,
**MPI**(My bachelor's work was closely related to this)
I don't have real experience excluding MPI

## English
I have more than 5 year in the computer with using english on the
forums or chats(also voice chat), in something articles or changelog,
but my understanding for time forms or hard language construction still low.
On the last course, we have english lessons and it was almost no problem.
